# Netsells React Native Technical Test

We would like you to complete a small app that lets you view reddit posts from [r/reactnative](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactnative/) and display some information about it.

You can get a JSON feed of a sub reddit by appending .json to any sub reddit url e.g https://www.reddit.com/r/reactnative.json

This isn't a design task so don't worry too much about UI/UX - a ListView would be fine

Some things to consider:

* Error Handling
* Unit Tests
* Handling offline situations gracefully

We appreciate that everyone is busy and has other obligations. Not everyone can spend loads of time on a technical task. So to level the field we request that you don't spend any longer than 3 hours on this task.

Please create a private git repository (ideally github) and commit your code there as you work on it, this will show us how you use git and how quickly you did the task.

Once you are done, please bundle your repository and send the bundle file over to your point of contact

```bash
git bundle create <yourname>.bundle --all --branches
```
